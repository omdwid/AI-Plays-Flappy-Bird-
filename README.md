# AI Plays Flappy Bird
This project is an AI agent that learns to play the Flappy Bird game using a neuroevolution algorithm. It uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) framework to evolve neural networks that control the bird’s movement. The neural networks receive the bird’s position, velocity, and the distance to the next pipe as inputs, and output a binary value indicating whether to flap or not. The neural networks are evaluated based on their fitness, which is the score they achieve in the game. The best neural network is saved and can be loaded to play the game.

## Installation
Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pygame
neat-python
You can install them using pip:

```bash
